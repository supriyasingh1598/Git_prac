  <Description>Identity attribute rules are used in conditions where we don't have a one-to-one mapping between attribute and value and where multiple attributes might have to be used to define the value of an identity attribute.

A global rule is called for each identity that is processed. A global rule can use the Identity's Link objects to get at the tribute values necessary to derive the identity attribute value.

In this example the rule checks two account attributes to derive the value. First check with the hr app's job code then check the ad account's description field.</Description>
